# Changelog

This project follows a simple changelog discipline:

- keep user-visible changes in `Unreleased` until the next cut
- group entries by impact, not by file
- call out migration-impacting changes explicitly

## Unreleased

_No user-visible changes yet._

## 0.1.1

### Added

- Homebrew installation support (`brew install cmakefmt/cmakefmt/cmakefmt`)
- shell completion installation instructions
- site metadata and crate status badge on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs)

### Changed

- improved [docs.rs](https://docs.rs) readability and tightened public API surface
- documentation clarity and wording improvements

## 0.1.0

### Added

- full CLI workflow: `--check`, `--diff`, `--in-place`, `--staged`,
  `--changed`, `--files-from`, `--parallel`, `--dump-config`, `--list-input`,
  `--list-changed`, `--explain-config`, `--quiet`, `--keep-going`
- recursive file discovery with `.cmakefmtignore` and `--exclude-regex` support
- YAML and TOML config file support with automatic discovery
- comment preservation and fence/barrier support (`# cmakefmt: off/on`)
- pragma-gated rollout mode
- formatter result caching
- colored diff output and in-place progress bar
- CI-oriented report formats (JSON, JUnit, SARIF, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- legacy `cmake-format` config conversion (`--convert-config`)
- built-in and module-command spec coverage audited against CMake 4.3.1
- custom command specifications via config
- real-world regression corpus covering LLVM, Qt, protobuf, and more
- performance benchmarks: ~20× geometric-mean speedup over `cmake-format`
- parallel formatting with `--parallel`
- comprehensive docs site at [cmakefmt.dev](https://cmakefmt.dev)
- shell completion generation (`--completions`)
- dual MIT/Apache-2.0 licensing with full REUSE compliance
- Windows, macOS, and Linux support

### Compatibility Notes

- `cmakefmt` aims to be easy to migrate to from `cmake-format`, but output is
  not intended to be byte-for-byte identical
- config option names differ from `cmake-format` in places; use
  `--convert-config` to migrate

## Release Process

For each release:

1. move relevant `Unreleased` entries into a versioned heading
2. summarize major user-visible changes
3. note any compatibility or migration impact
4. link the release tag or GitHub release when published
